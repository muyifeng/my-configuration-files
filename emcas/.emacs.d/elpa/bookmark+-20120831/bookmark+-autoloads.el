*File associations for bookmark handlers used for indirect bookmarks.
Each element of the alist is (REGEXP . COMMAND).
REGEXP matches a file name.
COMMAND is a sexp that evaluates to either a shell command (a string)
 or an Emacs function (a symbol or a lambda form).  The shell command
 or Lisp function must accept a file-name argument.

Example value:

 ((\"\\\\.pdf$\"   . \"AcroRd32.exe\") ; Adobe Acrobat Reader
  (\"\\\\.ps$\"    . \"gsview32.exe\") ; Ghostview (PostScript viewer)
  (\"\\\\.html?$\" . browse-url)       ; Use Lisp function `browse-url'
  (\"\\\\.doc$\"   . w32-browser))     ; Use Lisp function `w32-browser'

When you change this option using Customize, if you want to use a
literal string as COMMAND then you must double-quote the text:
\"...\".  (But do not use double-quotes for the REGEXP.)  If you want
to use a symbol as COMMAND, just type the symbol name (no quotes).

the default `file-handler' property for a given file bookmark.  If a

Functions to produce the default name for a new bookmark.
\(The default name for an *existing* bookmark is obtained using
`bmkp-default-bookmark-name'.)

The option value is a list of functions that do not require an
argument and return a string (or nil).  They are invoked in order to
produce the default names.

The following names are also provided, after the names described
above: The value of variable `bookmark-current-bookmark' and the
return value of function `bookmark-buffer-name', in that order.

These latter names are the defaults provided by vanilla Emacs
`bookmark.el', so if you want the vanilla behavior then set the option
value to nil.

For non-interactive use of a default bookmark name, and for Emacs
prior to Emacs 23 even for interactive use, only the first default
name is used.

Some functions you might want to use in the option value:

 * `region-or-non-nil-symbol-name-nearest-point'
 * (lambda () (let ((ff  (function-called-at-point)))
      (and (symbolp ff)  (symbol-name ff))))
 * (lambda () (let ((vv  (variable-at-point))) ; `variable-at-point'
      (and (symbolp vv)  (symbol-name vv))))   ;  returns 0 if no var
 * `word-at-point'
 * (lambda () (let ((ss  (symbol-at-point)))
     (and ss  (symbol-name ss))))

The first of these is defined in library `thingatpt+.el'.  It returns
the text in the region, if it is active and not empty.  Otherwise it
returns the name of the (non-`nil') symbol nearest point, within
maximum search distances `tap-near-point-x-distance' (left and right)

*Predicate or predicates for sorting (comparing) bookmarks.
This defines the default sort for bookmarks in the bookmark list.

Various sorting commands, such as \\<bookmark-bmenu-mode-map>`\\[bmkp-bmenu-sort-by-bookmark-visit-frequency]', change the value of this
option dynamically (but they do not save the changed value).

The value must be one of the following:

* nil, meaning do not sort

* a predicate that takes two bookmarks as args

* a list of the form ((PRED...) FINAL-PRED), where each PRED and
  FINAL-PRED are predicates that take two bookmarks as args

If the value is a list of predicates, then each PRED is tried in turn
until one returns a non-nil value.  In that case, the result is the
car of that value.  If no non-nil value is returned by any PRED, then
FINAL-PRED is used and its value is the result.

Each PRED should return `(t)' for true, `(nil)' for false, or nil for
undecided.  A nil value means that the next PRED decides (or
FINAL-PRED, if there is no next PRED).

Thus, a PRED is a special kind of predicate that indicates either a
boolean value (as a singleton list) or \"I cannot decide - let the
next guy else decide\".  (Essentially, each PRED is a hook function
that is run using `run-hook-with-args-until-success'.)

Examples:

 nil           - No sorting.

 string-lessp  - Single predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

 ((p1 p2))     - Two predicates `p1' and `p2', which each return
                 (t) for true, (nil) for false, or nil for undecided.

 ((p1 p2) string-lessp)
               - Same as previous, except if both `p1' and `p2' return
                 nil, then the return value of `string-lessp' is used.

Note that these two values are generally equivalent, in terms of their
effect (*):

 ((p1 p2))
 ((p1) p2-plain) where p2-plain is (bmkp-make-plain-predicate p2)

Likewise, these three values generally act equivalently (*):

 ((p1))
 (() p1-plain)
 p1-plain        where p1-plain is (bmkp-make-plain-predicate p1)

The PRED form lets you easily combine predicates: use `p1' unless it
cannot decide, in which case try `p2', and so on.  The value ((p2 p1))
tries the predicates in the opposite order: first `p2', then `p1' if
`p2' returns nil.

Using a single predicate or FINAL-PRED makes it easy to reuse an
existing predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

You can also convert a PRED-type predicate (which returns (t), (nil),
or nil) into an ordinary predicate, by using function
`bmkp-make-plain-predicate'.  That lets you reuse elsewhere, as
ordinary predicates, any PRED-type predicates you define.

For example, this defines a plain predicate to compare by URL:
 (defalias 'bmkp-url-p (bmkp-make-plain-predicate 'bmkp-url-cp))

Note: As a convention, predefined Bookmark+ PRED-type predicate names
have the suffix `-cp' (for \"component predicate\") instead of `-p'.

--
* If you use `\\[bmkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]', then there is a difference in behavior between

   (a) using a plain predicate as FINAL-PRED and

for prompting are as follows (in order of priority):

 * If in W3M mode, then the current W3M title.

 * If in a Gnus mode, then the Gnus summary article header.

 * If on a `man' page, then the page name (command and section).

 * If the region is active and nonempty, then the buffer name followed
   by \": \" and the region prefix (up to
   `bmkp-bookmark-name-length-max' chars).

 * The names defined by option `bmkp-new-bookmark-default-names'.

 * The value of variable `bookmark-current-bookmark', the name of the
   last-used bookmark for the current file.

 * The value returned by function `bookmark-buffer-name'.

For Emacs 23+, all of the names described above are available as
default values, by repeating `M-n'.  For older Emacs versions, the
first name provided is the only default value.

While entering a bookmark name at the prompt:

 * You can use (lax) completion against bookmarks in the same buffer.
   If there are no bookmarks in the current buffer, then all bookmarks
   are completion candidates.  (See also below, about a numeric prefix
   argument.)

 * You can use `C-M-w' to yank words from the buffer to the
   minibuffer.  Repeating `C-M-w' yanks successive words (newlines
   between yanked words are stripped out).

 * You can use `C-M-u' to insert the name of the last bookmark used in
   the buffer.  This can be useful as an aid to track your progress
   through a large file.  (If no bookmark has yet been used, then
   `C-M-u' inserts the name of the visited file.)

A prefix argument changes the behavior as follows:

 * Numeric prefix arg: Use all bookmarks as completion candidates,
   instead of just the bookmarks for the current buffer.

 * Plain prefix arg (`C-u'): Do not overwrite a bookmark that has the
   same name as NAME, if such a bookmark already exists.  Instead,
   push the new bookmark onto the bookmark alist.

   The most recently set bookmark named NAME is thus the one in effect
   at any given time, but any others named NAME are still available,
   should you decide to delete the most recent one.

Reverse the application of multi-sorting predicates.
These are the PRED predicates described for option

This reverses the order in which the predicates are tried, and it
also complements the truth value returned by each predicate.

For example, if the list of multi-sorting predicates is (p1 p2 p3),
then the predicates are tried in the order: p3, p2, p1.  And if a
predicate returns true, `(t)', then the effect is as if it returned
false, `(nil)', and vice versa.

The use of multi-sorting predicates tends to group bookmarks, with the
first predicate corresponding to the first bookmark group etc.

The effect of \\<bookmark-bmenu-mode-map>`\\[bmkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' is roughly as follows:

 - without also `\\[bmkp-reverse-sort-order]', it reverses the bookmark order in each group

 - combined with `\\[bmkp-reverse-sort-order]', it reverses the order of the bookmark
   groups, but not the bookmarks within a group

This is a rough description.  The actual behavior can be complex,
because of how each predicate is defined.  If this description helps
you, fine.  If not, just experiment and see what happens. ;-)

Remember that ordinary `\\[bmkp-reverse-sort-order]' reversal on its own is straightforward.
If you find `\\[bmkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' confusing or not helpful, then do not use it.

(autoload 'bmkp-define-sort-command "bookmark+-mac" "\
Define a command to sort bookmarks in the bookmark list by SORT-ORDER.
SORT-ORDER is a short string or symbol describing the sorting method.
Examples: \"by last access time\", \"by bookmark name\".

The new command is named by replacing any spaces in SORT-ORDER with
hyphens (`-') and then adding the prefix `bmkp-bmenu-sort-'.  Example:
`bmkp-bmenu-sort-by-bookmark-name', for SORT-ORDER `by bookmark name'.

COMPARER compares two bookmarks, returning non-nil if and only if the
first bookmark sorts before the second.  It must be acceptable as a
value of `bmkp-sort-comparer'.  That is, it is either nil, a
predicate, or a list ((PRED...) FINAL-PRED).  See the doc for
`bmkp-sort-comparer'.

DOC-STRING is the doc string of the new command.

(autoload 'bmkp-define-file-sort-predicate "bookmark+-mac" "\
Define a predicate for sorting bookmarks by file attribute ATT-NB.
See function `file-attributes' for the meanings of the various file
attribute numbers.

String attribute values sort alphabetically; numerical values sort
numerically; nil sorts before t.

For ATT-NB 0 (file type), a file sorts before a symlink, which sorts
before a directory.

For ATT-NB 2 or 3 (uid, gid), a numerical value sorts before a string
value.

A bookmark that has file attributes sorts before a bookmark that does
not.  A file bookmark sorts before a non-file bookmark.  Only local
files are tested for attributes - remote-file bookmarks are treated
here like non-file bookmarks.
